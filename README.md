### DATA CHALLENGES

***

Using python:

1) Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

2) Build a movie recommender system using a Python library such as Surprise or FastFM.

3) Linear Model: Fit a regression model (with an out-of-sample R42 of > 0.01) to a financial time series. Financial series have a low signal-to-noise ratio, so even a weak correlation will require some basic feature engineering (moving average prices, volatility, etc). What are some of the weaknesses of the model an how can it be improved with additional work?
